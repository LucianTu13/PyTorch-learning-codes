# Copilot Instructions for pytorch-learning

This project currently has no source files or documentation. To help AI coding agents be productive as the codebase evolves, follow these guidelines:

## Project Overview
- This is a placeholder for a PyTorch-based learning project. The structure and conventions will be updated as code is added.

## Conventions
- Place all source code in clearly named subdirectories (e.g., `src/`, `models/`, `data/`).
- Add a `README.md` at the project root to describe the project purpose, setup, and usage as soon as possible.
- Use standard Python and PyTorch best practices unless otherwise documented here.

## Workflows
- Document any custom build, test, or data preparation steps in the `README.md` or in this file as they are introduced.
- Prefer `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` for dependency management.

## AI Agent Guidance
- Update this file with project-specific instructions as the codebase grows.
- Reference key files and directories as they are created.
- Document any non-standard patterns or integration points.

**Next Steps:**
- As you add code, update this file to reflect important patterns, workflows, and conventions unique to this project.
- If you have questions about what to document, ask the project maintainer.
